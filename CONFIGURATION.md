# Configuration Fields

## Sensors
Sensor outputs are collected in the "/Sensors/" directory. The _Sensors_ JSON object is simply an array of sensors on the aircraft.

### Time
Time since the FMU booted, in microseconds. Specify the output location.
``` json
{ "Type": "Time", "Output": "Fmu/Time_us"}
```
### Voltages
Four different voltages are available:
   * "InputVoltage": the voltage input to the FMU
   * "RegulatedVoltage": the regulated voltage from the FMU voltage regulator
   * "PwmVoltage": the voltage of the PWM servo rail, this is available on the FMU or nodes.
   * "SbusVoltage": the voltage of the SBUS servo rail, this is available on the FMU or nodes.
Specify the output location. The output is appropriately scaled and converted to voltage.
``` json
{ "Type": "InputVoltage", "Output": "Fmu/Voltage/Input_V"}
```

### MPU-9250 IMU

### BME-280 Static Pressure Sensor

### SBUS Receiver
Measures and scales the 16 SBUS receiver channels to a -1 to +1 range. The input port is labeled SBUS RX on the FMU and nodes. Specify the output location.
``` json
{ "Type": "Sbus", "Output": "Sbus"}
```
### uBlox GNSS
uBlox GNSS data. The uBlox GNSS receiver must be setup to send the UBX-NAV-PVT packet at the desired rate using the [u-center software](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/u-center). Configurable items include the UART port number, baudrate, and output location.
``` json
{ "Type": "uBlox", "Output": "uBlox", "Uart": 4, "Baud": 115200}
```
### Swift Air Data
Pitot-static data from the [Swift Air Data sensor](https://bolderflight.com/technical/#swift-air-data). Configurable items include the I2C bus, I2C addresses, the differential transducer type, and output location. Data is scaled appropriately and output in units of Pa.
``` json
{ "Type": "Swift", "Output": "Pitot", "I2c": 1,
          "Static": {"Address": 20},
          "Differential": {"Address": 21, "Transducer": "AMS5915-0020-D"}
```
### AMS-5915 Pressure Transducers
Pressure data from AMS-5915 pressure transducers. Configurable items include the I2C bus, I2C address, transducer type, and output location. Data is scaled appropriately and output in units of Pa.
``` json
{ "Type": "Ams5915", "Output": "diff_press", "I2c": 1, "Address": 29, "Transducer": "AMS5915-0020-D-B"}
```
