Example JSON configuration:

    "Time": "",
    "Groups": [
      { "Name": "GroupName"
        "Components": [
          { "Level": "1",
            "Components": [
              {"Waveform": "0_5-Sec-Pulse","Signal": "","Start-Time": 1,"Scale-Factor": 0.2}

    "0_5-Sec-Pulse": {
      "Type": "Pulse"
      "Duration": 5
    }
  }
}

Where:
   * Time is the full path to the current system time in us
   * Groups is a vector of excitation groups, each group contains:
      * Name, the name of the group used to identify it in the test points
      * Components, the group components, organized into levels corresponding to
        the control law levels and definining a vector of waveforms that will be run
         * Each waveform is defined by name, the signal it's modifying (i.e. "/Control/Pitch_Cmd"),
           the start time in seconds and the amplitude
   * Each waveform is defined by name, the type of waveform, and any other information needed by the specific waveform type
